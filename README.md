Data analysis and insights for care home management.


## Description
This project focuses on data analysis and insights for care home management.

## Questions to Ask of the Dataset
### Staffing Optimization
- How do staffing levels vary across different shifts, days of the week, and care homes?
- Are there any patterns or trends in staffing needs based on resident care metrics?
- Can we identify peak times for incidents or resident needs that require additional staffing resources?

### Impact of Staffing on Resident Care Quality
- Is there a correlation between staffing levels and incident rates (e.g., falls, medication errors)?
- How do resident satisfaction scores vary with different staffing levels and staff-to-resident ratios?
- Are there differences in health outcomes (e.g., hospital readmissions) associated with varying staffing levels?

### Cost Efficiency
- What is the cost breakdown of staffing expenses compared to other operational costs?
- Can we identify opportunities to optimize staffing levels to minimize costs while maintaining or improving resident care quality?
- How do changes in staffing levels impact the care home's financial performance and profitability?

### Predictive Analysis
- Can we develop predictive models to forecast staffing needs based on historical data and resident care metrics?
- How accurately can we predict incident rates or resident satisfaction scores based on staffing levels and other relevant factors?

## Solution Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- Statistical analysis to identify correlations between staffing levels, resident care metrics, and financial performance.
- Development of predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast staffing needs and predict resident care outcomes.
- Optimization algorithms to find the optimal staffing levels that balance resident care quality with cost efficiency.

## Conclusion
By solving this problem, the care home can make data-driven decisions to allocate staffing resources more effectively, leading to improved resident care quality, enhanced staff satisfaction, and better financial outcomes.
